- `options` is an object which contain:
  - `throwable` (optional) - defines if it's needed to throw an exception or just return an empty array if some operation can't be completed; default: `false`;
  - `isCsv` (optional) - defines is content must be returned as CSV (if `true`) or JSON (if `false`); default: `false`;
  - `isStream` (optional) - defines if content is represented as stream (if `true`) or stringified data (if `false`); default: `false`.

# Usage

1. Init a new project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm i read-spreadsheet
   ```

3. Create `index.js` file with the following content: 
   ```javascript
   const readSpreadsheet = require('read-spreadsheet');
   
   (async () => {
     const jsonContent = await readSpreadsheet('u193j19jr-q9ew8ur98urq-32uruwr1h2k3h1k');
   
     // just to print it in readable format
     console.log(JSON.stringify(jsonContent, null, 2));
   })();
   ```  

4. Run it:
   ```bash
   node ./index
   ```
   **Note:**
   
   If you want to use debugger mode you should set this environment variable and run the code:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=read-spreadsheet node ./index
   ```
   For this mode in case of normal work you mustn't see anything in the console. In the opposite case you will see an error description even if `throwable` is `false`.
