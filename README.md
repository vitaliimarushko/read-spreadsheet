- `options` is an object which contain:
  - `throwable` (boolean) - defines if it's needed to throw an exception or just return an empty result if some operation can't be completed; default: `false`;
  - `isCsv` (boolean) - defines if content must be returned as CSV (if `true`) or JSON (if `false`); default: `false`;
  - `isStream` (boolean) - defines if content is represented as a readable stream with processed data (if `true`) or just stringified data (if `false`); default: `false`;
  - `directStream` (boolean) - defines if you need to receive a direct stream of reading spreadsheet document without any modifications as it is; ignores `isCsv` and `isStream` options; default: `false`;
  - `eolType` (string) - sets symbols for the end of line for CSV content if `isCsv = true` and `directStream = false`; default value is that which is relevant for OS where the package is being used;
  - `gid` (string) - sets an ID of a sheet from a spreadsheet document; the 1st sheet is read if not set; default: `null`. You can get it from here:

# Usage

1. Init a new project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   npm i read-spreadsheet
   ```

3. Create `index.js` file with the following content: 
   ```javascript
   const readSpreadsheet = require('read-spreadsheet');
   
   (async () => {
     // use your real spreadsheet ID!
     const jsonContent = await readSpreadsheet('u193j19jr-q9ew8ur98urq-32uruwr1h2k3h1k');
   
     // just to print it in the readable format
     console.log(JSON.stringify(jsonContent, null, 2));
   })();
   ```  

4. Run it:
   ```bash
   node ./index
   ```
   **Note:** If you want to use debugger mode you should set this environment variable and run the code:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=read-spreadsheet node ./index
   ```
   For this mode in case of normal work you mustn't see anything in the console. In the opposite case you will see an error description even if `throwable` is `false`.
